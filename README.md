# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
 timely delivery helps to meet customer satisfaction, business reputation, market competitiveness, financial stability, and overall project success by ensuring software is delivered on schedule, meeting client expectations and allowing them to capitalize on its benefits promptly. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by assigning adequate resources required for the projects,motivating the developers,conducting team meeetings to ensure sprints are covered and there is an actual progress in the project.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
cost control helps to make sure that the project development does not pass the set budget .It can be achieved by proper use of present resources,responsibility from the team members,not including features that may take more resources than it was expected and going for alternate cheaper but effective solutions for the project development.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is and iterative methodology where the team members are issued with sprints or features to complete and this is done recursively until the project is completed.Waterfall on the other hand focuses on the completion of one feature before going to the next and the outputs of one phase are the inputs of the next phase.
##### Advantages of agile
* it is easier to change the sourcecode with to accomodate new features.
* Different team member can work on different features of the program at the same time.
* Mvps can be developed and deployed fast and they help to collect feedback from users and clients.
#### Disadvantages of agile
* agile requires strong team collaboration.
* Release dates are uncertain
* requires high management.
#### Advantages of waterfall
  * clear project structure with all the requirements declared prior.
  * requires less management as compared to agile.
  * suitable for projects which won't be modified later.
 #### Disadvantages of waterfall
  * waterfall has delayed customer feedback as it is supposed to be complete before releasing to the users.
  * it is hard to add new features as the requirements are already set.
  * it lacks flexibility and it is hard to scale in future.
